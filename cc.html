Key Kracker</button>
<br>
<p>After downloading the two files from above, launch the Creative Cloud Installer jar. There is no GUI, so you just have to wait for a few minutes so that it can fetch all the necessary packages for the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite. Keep in mind that it is installing the <strong>ENTIRE SUITE</strong>, so patience is a necessity. Since there is no GUI, there is no actual way of telling if it is installed yet. The developer of the installer says that you should wait from 30-50 minutes, depending on the speed of your computer/network before you carry on with the steps. Don't worry though because, the long wait will be worth it. After about 30-50 minutes or so, you can proceed to launch the Key Kracker. This is a patcher which tricks the software into thinking that you are logged in with a paid account and allows you to use all Creative Cloud software FOREVER. A command-line interface will pop-up when you launch the patcher. It will show you your current key (the trial key) and it will ask for another key. You then will paste into it the following key:</p>

<br>
<p>After pasting in the key, hit enter. It may seem that it is frozen but be patient. After a minute or so, it will spit out another long key. Paste that key into a text file for future reference but other than that, you're ready to go. Yo have unlimited access to the Creative Cloud apps after a few easy steps. Enjoy!</p>
